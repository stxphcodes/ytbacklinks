Hi ProductHunt! I've been working on YoutubeBacklinks over the past few months and I'm so excited to finally be able to launch the site on this platform.

I created YoutubeBacklinks to fix a problem that I experienced personally. As someone who watches a lot of lifestyle, DIY and tech videos on Youtube, I'm often left searching for product links or discount codes days or weeks after watching a video because the native Youtube search engine doesn't parse through description box text.

That's the main reason I created the site. The search engine behind YoutubeBacklinks parses video description boxes for links and discount codes to make it easy for your future self to find that URL.


More than anything, I'm looking for feedback on the site - ideas for features that could make the site more useful or if it's something you could see yourself using, feel free to add a new channel to the site!

Thanks

As someone who grew up following aesthetic youtube vloggers and
wanting to curate a life like theirs, I was stoked to move to a
brand new apartment earlier this year with my partner and pup. I
watched a lot of youtube vidoes to get inspiration on how to fill
the new space, everything ranging from house decor and furniture to
tech recommendations and culinary essentials.

The youtubers I watch often review or mention products in their
videos, and will link the product (usually with a discount code or
affiliate link) in the description box. However, finding the link
when I needed it days or weeks later was always an arduous process.
I would have to sift through multiple videos in my history before
getting the right one since the native Youtube search box doesn't
search through all of the description box text.
<br />
<br /> That's the main reason I created this web app. The search
engine behind YoutubeBacklinks prioritizes description box text, and
it also displays description boxes for multiple videos in one screen
so it makes it easier to sift through and find what you're looking
for. <br /> <br />I hope this site can be as useful to you as it is
to me! Feel free to add a new channel by filling out{" "}
